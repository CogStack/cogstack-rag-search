# Mock databases

The data sources in this folder are taken from here: (https://github.com/adam-sutton-1992/omop_es/tree/master/source_access/UCLH/mock_database)

- We provide some basic python scripts to load these into a series of SQLite databases 
- We also add to this the cogstack-db folders

to create the databases run `python create_dbs.py`
